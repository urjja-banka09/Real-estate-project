Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
API keys for Google Places and Hugging Face

Required Python libraries:
requests
pandas

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-analysis.git
cd real-estate-analysis

Install Dependencies:
pip install requests pandas
Add Your API Keys:
Replace "YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY" and "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY" in the analyze_real_estate function with your actual API keys.

Functionality
1. Identify Competitive Real Estate Projects
Fetch competitive real estate projects within a specified radius from a given location using the Google Places API.

2. Obtain Key Details
Retrieve detailed information about each project using Google Places API.

3. Compare Amenities
Use Hugging Faceâ€™s BART model to summarize the amenities of each project. This step involves:

Generating summaries of amenities.
Comparing these summaries to identify key differences and advantages.

4. Modular Function
The analyze_real_estate function performs the entire analysis process and returns a DataFrame with the summarized comparison of real estate projects.

Usage
Define API Keys and Parameters:
Ensure you have the correct API keys and set up the parameters, including location coordinates and radius.

Run the Analysis:

python
Copy code
api_keys = {
    "google_places": "YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY",
    "huggingface": "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY"
}
location_coords = "12.902111609527427,77.63996575110015"
radius = 10000
project_details_df = pd.DataFrame()  # Your DataFrame with project details
amenities_df = pd.DataFrame()  # Your DataFrame with amenities details

results = analyze_real_estate(location_coords, radius, api_keys, project_details_df, amenities_df)
print(results)
Review Results:
The function will output a DataFrame with the summarized details of competing real estate projects.

Deployment
Serverless Deployment:
Deploy the analyze_real_estate function as a serverless function using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, or Azure Function.

API Integration:
Optionally, use an API Gateway to expose the function as a web service.

Testing
Unit Testing:
Test the analyze_real_estate function with different inputs and validate the output.

Performance Testing:
Ensure the function performs efficiently with large datasets.
