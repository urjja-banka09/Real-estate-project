##Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for Google Places and Hugging Face
- Required Python libraries:
   - requests
   - pandas

Setup and Installation

1.Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-analysis.git

cd real-estate-analysis

1.Install Dependencies:

pip install requests pandas

1. Add Your API Keys: Replace "YOUR\_GOOGLE\_PLACES\_API\_KEY" and "YOUR\_HUGGINGFACE\_API\_KEY" in the analyze\_real\_estate function with your actual API keys.

Functionality

1. Identify Competitive Real Estate Projects

Fetch competitive real estate projects within a specified radius from a given location using the Google Places API.

1. Obtain Key Details

Retrieve detailed information about each project using Google Places API.

1. Compare Amenities

Use Hugging Faceâ€™s BART model to summarize the amenities of each project. This step involves:

- Generating summaries of amenities.
- Comparing these summaries to identify key differences and advantages.

4\. Modular Function

The analyze\_real\_estate function performs the entire analysis process and returns a DataFrame with the summarized comparison of real estate projects.

Usage

1. Define API Keys and Parameters: Ensure you have the correct API keys and set up the parameters, including location coordinates and radius.
1. Run the Analysis:

api\_keys = {

"google\_places": "YOUR\_GOOGLE\_PLACES\_API\_KEY",

"huggingface": "YOUR\_HUGGINGFACE\_API\_KEY"

}

location\_coords = "12.902111609527427,77.63996575110015"

radius = 10000

project\_details\_df = pd.DataFrame()  # Your DataFrame with project details

amenities\_df = pd.DataFrame()  # Your DataFrame with amenities details

results = analyze\_real\_estate(location\_coords, radius, api\_keys, project\_details\_df, amenities\_df)

print(results)

1. Review Results: The function will output a DataFrame with the summarized details of competing real estate projects.

Deployment

1. Serverless Deployment: Deploy the analyze\_real\_estate function as a serverless function using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, or Azure Function.
1. API Integration: Optionally, use an API Gateway to expose the function as a web service.

Testing

1. Unit Testing: Test the analyze\_real\_estate function with different inputs and validate the output.
1. Performance Testing: Ensure the function performs efficiently with large datasets.
